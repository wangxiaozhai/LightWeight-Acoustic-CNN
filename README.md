# LightWeight-Acoustic-CNN
This repository provides a recognition model for disaster-related acoustic signals.  
It demonstrates how to preprocess acoustic signals, generate time-frequency representations, 
and train a modified deep learning model for binary classification tasks.  

A small portion of sub-audio (infrasound) recordings and pre-trained model weights are provided 
for demonstration purposes.
